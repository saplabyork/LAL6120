# Hillenbrand, Getty, Clark, and Wheeler (1995)

This paper (is now old) but was pretty influential at the time because it aimed to replicate a (much) earlier paper by [Peterson](images/gordon-peterson.jpeg) and Barney (1952) that exemplified one of the *problems of speech perception*, namely that phonological object (in this case a vowel) can have multiple acoustic realizations both within and between speakers (of varying age and gender). P&B recorded and analyzed canonical American English vowels produced in h-V-d contexts as produced by men, women, and children. The resulting image has been used in countless descriptions of the complexity of vowel spaces:

Hillbrand attempts to revisit P&B. Note that Hillenbrand is in central Michigan, which is quite different from the data P&B collected near the Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.

## P&B's measurements
- F1-F3 (Hz)
- F1-F3 (amplitude)
- F0

All measurements made from the "steady state" portion of the vowel. Why? $\rightarrow$ The middle section of a vowel is thought to be least affected by neighbouring segments (i.e., least coarticulation).

Let's do a quick exercise examining vowels and variability. Download the following three .wav files. Each has a list of hVd words in a carrier sentence. The vowels are: "hawed," "heed," "hood" (/u/ vowel), "had," "head," and "hud."

[hVd1](sounds/hvd1.wav)
[hvd2](sounds/hvd2.wav)
[hvd3](sounds/hvd3.wav)

Cut up these files and make vowel midpoint measurements (F1 and F2) for the target sounds. Then input your measurements into an Excel document and then save it as a .csv file to be read into R.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
